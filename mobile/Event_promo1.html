Winter Music Conference Announces 2012 Dates<br><br>

Winter Music Conference<br>
March 16-25, 2012<br>
Miami Beach, FL<br><br>

***For Immediate Release***<br>
October 12, 2011 – South Florida, U.S.A.<br>
Winter Music Conference (WMC) opened its 2012 season in South Florida today with the announcement of the Winter Music Conference 2012 dates. This will be the 27th annual program for what is largely regarded as the pre-eminent platform on the global music industry calendar for launching new music, technology and trends. Winter Music Conference Week 2012 happens March 16 – 25, 2012 in Miami Beach, Florida.
For 2012, WMC plans to further enhance the WMC experience by delivering ten non-stop days of music programming in Miami Beach and Miami. This expansion will wrap the program week with two full weekends of parties and events. WMC Co-founder, Bill Kelly, explains, "Expanding the WMC dates was an easy decision given the high demand of artists, businesses and industry delegates. Miami Beach and the greater Miami area boast some of the most celebrated event and club venues as well as the hotels and resorts that comprise South Beach's famed Art Deco District. Hotels, restaurants, cafes, shops and every sort of possible entertainment venue are filled to capacity during WMC Week to the point where five days just wasn't enough."
New for 2012, WMC will be unveiling correlated segments of its industry program dedicated to music and fashion on its opening weekend and indie rock meets electronica programming under the WMC Rocks header on the closing weekend, in addition to its standard programming and events. More details will be announced over the coming weeks.
